## Quick note about Rust from me

Rust is a programming language created and mainly developed by Mozilla Foundation, initially to create the new web-engine for Firefox. From my experience in University is that people call this things like
* Love child of C++ and Haskell
* Haskell for C++ enthusiasts
* C++ if it was created today
* C++ with Haskell's type system
