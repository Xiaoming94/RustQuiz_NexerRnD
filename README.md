RUST QUIZ Nexer Engineering
================

This repo contains a set of Quiz, problems and some other material useful for learning Rust. These are tailored specifically for C++ developers at Nexer Engineering SW.

## Quick words from me regarding rust

Rust is a programming language created and mainly developed by Mozilla Foundation, initially to create the new web-engine for Firefox. From my experience in University is that people call this things like

* Love child of C++ and Haskell
* Haskell for C++ enthusiasts
* C++ if it was created today
* C++ with Haskell's type system.

While these description all touches the essence of rust to a certain degree, but, in my opinion, their helpfulness in learning the language is limited - especially if you are only familiar with C++. In fact, I think learning Rust is easiest if you go in with an open mind. "Empty your cup" so to say.

With that said, there might be multiple elements in rust that is recognizable to the programmer learning it. Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language. While the core of the programming language is still *imperative*, it has comparatively more declarative elements compared to more conventional imperative languages like C/C++. It also has some recognizable elements from object oriented languages.
