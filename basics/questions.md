# Basic Questions

These are the basic questions. The goal is to teach you the basics in a practical way, you can also use these to test your knowledge if you taken some of the other courses like the ones I recommended in [README](../README.md).

I've decided to divide these questions into parts.

## Part 1
### Question 1
Consider this rust function:
```rust
fn add_two_numbers(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
    a + b
}
```
This function is roughly be translate to this function if written in C++ 
```C++
//necessary includes
std::uint32_t add_two_numbers(std::uin32_t a, std::uint32_t b) 
{
    return a + b;
}
```

* From this snippet alone, what do you think is the `fn` part in the rust code?
* What is to the right of the `->` charcters?

### Question 2
To spice things up a bit, lets add some prints. Lets add some additional operations in the `add_two_numbers` function in rust.

```rust
fn  add_two_numbers(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
    let ans = a + b;
    println!("adding numbers: {a} + {b} = {ans}");
    ans
}
```

* Why is there an exclaimation mark in the `println!()` function?
* What do you think the `let` keyword means?
* [*This one is harder*] The last part of this function can also be written as `return ans;`
  * What does the semicolon `;` do?
  * Why do you need it if you use `return`?
  * What would happen if you used `;` without `return`?
  * [*Discussion/thinking*] Why does rust have 2 different ways of returning something from a function? When should you use one or the other?
